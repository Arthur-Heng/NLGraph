In an undirected graph, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 4, and every node has an embedding. (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
Embeddings:
node 0: [1,1]
node 1: [0,1]
node 2: [0,1]
node 3: [1,1]
node 4: [0,1]
The edges are: (0,1) (1,4) (2,1) (2,4) (4,3)
In a simple graph convolution layer, each node's embedding is updated by the sum of its neighbors' embeddings.
Q: What's the embedding of each node after one layer of simple graph convolution layer?
A:
Layer 1:
node 0: sum of embeddings of node 1, [0,1] = [0,1].
node 1: sum of embeddings of node 0, node 2, node 4, [1,1] + [0,1] + [0,1] = [1,3].
node 2: sum of embeddings of node 1, node 4, [0,1] + [0,1] = [0,2].
node 3: sum of embeddings of node 4, [0,1] = [0,1].
node 4: sum of embeddings of node 1, node 2, node 3, [0,1] + [0,1] + [1,1] = [1,3]

So the answer is:
node 0: [1,3]
node 1: [1,6]
node 2: [2,6]
node 3: [1,3]
node 4: [1,6]


In an undirected graph, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 7, and every node has an embedding. (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
Embeddings:
node 0: [1,1]
node 1: [0,0]
node 2: [0,1]
node 3: [0,0]
node 4: [0,1]
node 5: [0,1]
node 6: [1,0]
node 7: [0,1]
The edges are: (0,4) (0,5) (0,6) (1,2) (2,3) (2,6) (3,4) (3,5) (3,7) (4,7) (4,6) (5,7) (5,6) (6,7)
