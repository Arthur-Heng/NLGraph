In an undirected graph, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 4, and every node has an embedding. (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
Embeddings:
node 0: [1,1]
node 1: [0,1]
node 2: [0,1]
node 3: [1,1]
node 4: [0,1]
The edges are: (0,1) (1,4) (2,1) (2,4) (4,3)
In a simple graph convolution layer, each node's embedding is updated by the sum of its neighbors' embeddings.
Q: What's the embedding of each node after one layer of simple graph convolution layer?
A:
The answer is:
node 0: [0,1]
node 1: [1,3]
node 2: [0,2]
node 3: [0,1]
node 4: [1,3]
