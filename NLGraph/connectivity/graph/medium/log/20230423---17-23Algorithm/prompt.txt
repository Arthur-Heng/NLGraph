To determine if there is a path between two nodes in an undirected graph, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
BFS is an algorithm that starts at one node and explores all of its neighbors before moving on to the next level of neighbors.
By exploring each node in the graph, the algorithm can determine if there is a path between two nodes.

Determine if there is a path between two nodes in the graph. Note that (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
Graph: (0,1) (1,2) (3,4) (4,5)
Q: Is there a path between node 1 and node 4?
A: Node 1 is in the connected block consisted of node 0, node 1, and node 2.
Node 4 is in the connected block consisting of node 3, node 4, and node 5. Node 1 and node 4 are not in the same connected block, so the answer is no.

Determine if there is a path between two nodes in the graph. Note that (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
Graph: (0,1) (0,2) (1,5) (1,2) (1,3) (2,5)
Q: Is there a path between node 2 and node 3?
A: Node 2 is connected to node 1, node 1 is connected to node 3. We can follow the path: 2->1->3, so the answer is yes.

Graph: (0,2) (0,5) (0,6) (1,3) (1,4) (2,5) (2,6) (3,4) (5,6)
Q: Is there a path between node 5 and node 4?
A: Node 5 is in the connected block consisted of node 0, node 2, node 5, and node 2.
Node 4 is in the connected block consisting of node 1, node 3, and node 4. Node 5 and node 4 are not in the same connected block, so the answer is no.

Graph: (0,1) (0,7) (0,6) (1,7) (1,5) (1,6) (5,9) (2,8) (2,4) (2,3) (3,8)
Q: Is there a path between node 7 and node 9?
A: Node 7 is connected to node 1, node 1 is connected to node 5, node 5 is connected to node 9.
We can follow the path: 7->1->5->9, so the answer is yes.
