Determine if there is a path between two nodes in the graph. Note that (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
Graph: (0,1) (1,2) (3,4) (4,5)
Q: Is there a path between node 1 and node 4?
A: Let's break down this problem: 1. 2.
1.Node 1 is in the connected block consisted of node 0, node 1, and node 2.
Node 4 is in the connected block consisting of node 3, node 4, and node 5. Node 1 and node 4 are not in the same connected block, so the answer is no.

Graph: (0,1) (0,2) (1,5) (1,2) (1,3) (2,5)
Q: Is there a path between node 2 and node 3?
A: Let's break down this problem: 1. 2.
Node 2 is connected to node 1, node 1 is connected to node 3. We can follow the path: 2->1->3, so the answer is yes.

Q: Is there a path between node 5 and node 4?
A: Let's break down this problem: 1. 2.
Node 5 is in the connected block consisted of node 0, node 2, node 5, and node 2.
Node 4 is in the connected block consisting of node 1, node 3, and node 4. Node 5 and node 4 are not in the same connected block, so the answer is no.

Q: Is there a path between node 7 and node 9?
A: Let's break down this problem: 1. 2.
Node 7 is connected to node 1, node 1 is connected to node 5, node 5 is connected to node 9.
We can follow the path: 7->1->5->9, so the answer is yes.
