In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 4, and the edges are: (4,2) (0,4) (4,3) (0,1) (0,2) (4,1) (2,3)
Let's construct a graph with the nodes and edges first.
Q: Is there a path in this graph that visits every node exactly once? If yes, give the path. Note that in a path, adjacent nodes must be connected with edges.
A: Yes. We can start at node 0. As node 0 is connected with ndoe 1, and node 1 is not visited, we can then visit node 1.
As node 1 is connected with ndoe 4, and node 4 is not visited, we can then visit node 4.
As node 4 is connected with ndoe 2, and node 2 is not visited, we can then visit node 2.
As node 2 is connected with ndoe 3, and node 3 is not visited, we can then visit node 3.
Therefore, the path can be: 0,1,4,2,3.
