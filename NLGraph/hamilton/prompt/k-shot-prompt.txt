In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 4, and the edges are: (4,2) (0,4) (4,3) (0,1) (0,2) (4,1) (2,3)
Q: Is there a path in this graph that visits every node exactly once? If yes, give the path. Note that in a path, adjacent nodes must be connected with edges.
A: Yes. The path can be: 0,1,4,2,3.

In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 4, and the edges are: (0,4) (1,5) (3,1) (4,2) (3,5) (2,1) (1,4) (2,5)
Q: Is there a path in this graph that visits every node exactly once? If yes, give the path. Note that in a path, adjacent nodes must be connected with edges.
A: Yes. The path can be: 1,3,5,2,4,0.

In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 5, and the edges are: (0,2) (0,1) (4,5) (4,3) (4,2) (5,3) (1,4) (2,5)
Q: Is there a path in this graph that visits every node exactly once? If yes, give the path. Note that in a path, adjacent nodes must be connected with edges.
A: Yes. The path can be: 0,2,5,3,4,1.
