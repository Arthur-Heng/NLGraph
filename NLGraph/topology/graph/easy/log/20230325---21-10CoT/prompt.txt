In a directed graph with n nodes numbered from 0 to 4:
node 1 should be visited before node 3
node 0 should be visited before node 3
node 1 should be visited before node 4
node 2 should be visited before node 4
node 0 should be visited before node 2
node 0 should be visited before node 4
node 0 should be visited before node 1
node 3 should be visited before node 4
Q: Can all the nodes be visited? Give the solution.
A: Node 0 can be visited at first as no nodes are required to be visited before it. After node 0 is visited, node 1 and node 2 can be visited.
After node 0 and node 1 are visited, node 3 can be visited. After node 0, node 1, node 2, node 3 are visited, node 4 can be visited. The solution is: 0,1,2,3,4.
