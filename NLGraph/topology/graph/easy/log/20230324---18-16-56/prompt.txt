In a directed graph with n nodes numbered from 0 to 9:
node 4 should be visited before node 9
node 3 should be visited before node 6
node 6 should be visited before node 7
node 0 should be visited before node 2
node 4 should be visited before node 6
node 1 should be visited before node 5
node 2 should be visited before node 6
node 5 should be visited before node 6
node 4 should be visited before node 5
node 0 should be visited before node 9
node 1 should be visited before node 6
node 1 should be visited before node 7
node 3 should be visited before node 4
node 2 should be visited before node 9
node 1 should be visited before node 4
node 0 should be visited before node 4
node 0 should be visited before node 7
node 2 should be visited before node 7
node 1 should be visited before node 3
node 2 should be visited before node 3
node 6 should be visited before node 8
node 0 should be visited before node 3
node 0 should be visited before node 6
node 3 should be visited before node 7
node 4 should be visited before node 7
node 4 should be visited before node 8
node 0 should be visited before node 8
node 6 should be visited before node 9
node 7 should be visited before node 8
node 5 should be visited before node 8
node 5 should be visited before node 7
node 8 should be visited before node 9
node 5 should be visited before node 9
Q: Can all the nodes be visited? Give the solution.
A: Let's think step by step:
Acc: 86/180
Namespace(model=0, mode='easy', prompt='0-CoT', T=0, token=400, SC=0)
