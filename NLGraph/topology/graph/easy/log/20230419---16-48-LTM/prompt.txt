In a directed graph with n nodes numbered from 0 to 4:
node 0 should be visited before node 4
node 0 should be visited before node 1
node 2 should be visited before node 1
node 3 should be visited before node 2
Q: Can all the nodes be visited? Give the solution.
A: Let's break down this problem: 1. How can the first half of the nodes be visited? 2. How can all the nodes be visited?
1. Since no nodes are required to be visited before node 0 and node 3, node 0 and node 3 can be visited first. After node 0 is visited,
node 4 can be visited. 
2. After node 3 is visited, node 2 can be visited. After node 0 and node 2 are visited, node 1 can be visited. So the solution is: 0,3,2,4,1.

A: Let's break down this problem: 1. How can the first half of the nodes be visited? 2. How can all the nodes be visited? 
1. Since no nodes are required to be visited before node 0 node 4 and node 5, node 0 node 4 and node 5 can be visited first.
2. After node 0 is visited, node 3 can be visited. After node 4 and node 5 are visited, node 1 can be visited. After node 1, node 3, node 4, and node 5 are visited, node 2 can be visited. So the solution is: 0,4,5,3,1,2.

2. After node 0 is visited, node 6 can be visited. After node 2 and node 6 are visited, node 5 can be visited.
After node 4 and node 6 are visited, node 3 can be visited. So the solution is: 2,4,0,1,6,5,3.
