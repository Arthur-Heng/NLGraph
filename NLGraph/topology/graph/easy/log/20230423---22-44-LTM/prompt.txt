In a directed graph with n nodes numbered from 0 to 4:
node 0 should be visited before node 4
node 0 should be visited before node 1
node 2 should be visited before node 1
node 3 should be visited before node 2
Q: Can all the nodes be visited? Give the solution.
A: Let's break down this problem: 1. How can the first half of the nodes be visited? 2. How can all the nodes be visited?
1. Since no nodes are required to be visited before node 0 and node 3, node 0 and node 3 can be visited first.
Since visiting node 4 requires visiting node 0 first, after node 0 is visited, node 4 can be visited.
2. Since visiting node 2 requires visiting node 3 first, after node 3 is visited, node 2 can be visited.
Since visiting node 1 requires visiting node 0, node 2 first, after node 0 and node 2 are visited, node 1 can be visited. So the solution is: 0,3,4,2,1.
