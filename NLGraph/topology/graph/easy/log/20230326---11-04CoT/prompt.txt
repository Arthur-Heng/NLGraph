In a directed graph with n nodes numbered from 0 to 4:
node 0 should be visited before node 1
node 1 should be visited before node 2
node 3 should be visited before node 1
node 3 should be visited before node 2
node 4 should be visited before node 3
node 4 should be visited before node 0
node 4 should be visited before node 1
Q: Can all the nodes be visited? Give the solution.
A: Since no nodes are required to be visited before node 4, node 4 can be visited first. After node 4 is visited, node 0 and node 3 can be visited.
After node 0, node 3, and node 4 are visited, node 1 can be visited. After node 1 and node 3 are visited, node 2 can be visited. So the solution is: 4,0,3,1,2.
