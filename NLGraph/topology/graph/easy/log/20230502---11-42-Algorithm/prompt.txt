To find a topological sort in a directed graph, you can follow the following steps:
1. Identify all the nodes in the given graph.
2. Create a list of all the nodes with no incoming edges.
3. Remove the node from the list and add it to the result list.
4. Remove any edges that were connected to that node.
5. Repeat Steps 2-4 until all nodes have been removed from the list.
6. The resulting list is the topological sort.

In a directed graph with 5 nodes numbered from 0 to 4:
node 0 should be visited before node 4
node 0 should be visited before node 1
node 2 should be visited before node 1
node 3 should be visited before node 2
Q: Can all the nodes be visited? Give the solution.
A: Since no nodes are required to be visited before node 0 and node 3, node 0 and node 3 can be visited first.
Since visiting node 4 requires visiting node 0 first, after node 0 is visited, node 4 can be visited.
Since visiting node 2 requires visiting node 3 first, after node 3 is visited, node 2 can be visited.
Since visiting node 1 requires visiting node 0, node 2 first, after node 0 and node 2 are visited, node 1 can be visited. So the solution is: 0,3,4,2,1.
