In a directed graph with 5 nodes numbered from 0 to 4:
node 0 should be visited before node 4
node 0 should be visited before node 1
node 2 should be visited before node 1
node 3 should be visited before node 2
Q: Can all the nodes be visited? Give the solution.
A: Since no nodes are required to be visited before node 0 and node 3, node 0 and node 3 can be visited first.
Since visiting node 4 requires visiting node 0 first, after node 0 is visited, node 4 can be visited.
Since visiting node 2 requires visiting node 3 first, after node 3 is visited, node 2 can be visited.
Since visiting node 1 requires visiting node 0, node 2 first, after node 0 and node 2 are visited, node 1 can be visited. So the solution is: 0,3,4,2,1.

node 4 should be visited before node 2
node 5 should be visited before node 1
node 5 should be visited before node 2
Q: Can all the nodes be visited? Give the solution.
A: Since no nodes are required to be visited before node 0 node 4 and node 5, node 0 node 4 and node 5 can be visited first.
Since visiting node 3 requires visiting node 0 first, after node 0 is visited, node 3 can be visited.
Since visiting node 1 requires visiting node 4, node 5 first, after node 4 and node 5 are visited, node 1 can be visited.
Since visiting node 2 requires visiting node 1, node 3, node 4, node 5 first, after node 1, node 3, node 4, and node 5 are visited, node 2 can be visited. So the solution is: 0,4,5,3,1,2.

Q: Can all the nodes be visited? Give the solution.
A: Since no nodes are required to be visited before node 1 and node 4, node 1 and node 4 can be visited first.
Since visiting node 2 requires visiting node 1, node 4 first, after node 1 and node 4 are visited, node 2 can be visited.
Since visiting node 3 requires visiting node 4 first, after node 4 is visited, node 3 can be visited.
Since visiting node 0 requires visiting node 1, node 3, node 4 first, after node 1, node 3, and node 4 are visited, node 0 can be visited.
Since visiting node 5 requires visiting node 0, node 3 first, after node 0 and node 3 are visited, node 5 can be visited. So the solution is: 1,4,2,3,0,5.

In a directed graph with 7 nodes numbered from 0 to 6:
node 0 should be visited before node 6

node 2 should be visited before node 5
node 4 should be visited before node 1
node 4 should be visited before node 3
node 6 should be visited before node 3
node 6 should be visited before node 5
Q: Can all the nodes be visited? Give the solution.
A: Since no nodes are required to be visited before node 2 and node 4, node 2 and node 4 can be visited first.
Since visiting node 0 requires visiting node 2 first, after node 2 is visited, node 0 can be visited.
Since visiting node 1 requires visiting node 4 first, after node 4 is visited, node 1 can be visited.
Since visiting node 6 requires visiting node 0 first, after node 0 is visited, node 6 can be visited.
Since visiting node 5 requires visiting node 2, node 6 first, after node 2 and node 6 are visited, node 5 can be visited.
Since visiting node 3 requires visiting node 4, node 6 first, after node 4 and node 6 are visited, node 3 can be visited. So the solution is: 2,4,0,1,6,5,3.
