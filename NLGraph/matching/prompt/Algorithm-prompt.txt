To assign jobs to job applicants in such that the maximum number of applicants find the job they are interested in, you can model the problem as a bipartite graph maximum matching problem, thinking of jobs and applicants as nodes in the bipartite graph.
The maximum matching in a bipartite graph can be found using the Hungarian algorithm.
This algorithm is used to find the maximum matching in a bipartite graph by assigning each vertex to its most preferred partner. The algorithm works by assigning each vertex to its most preferred partner, and then iteratively improving the matching until no further improvement can be made.
