In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 24, and the edges are: (9,10) (1,0) (2,22) (16,22) (22,13) (20,10) (15,18) (5,10) (10,6) (9,8) (17,4) (1,15) (11,2) (19,11) (5,3) (0,17) (2,0) (0,16) (24,2) (10,14) (20,0) (12,14) (23,5) (6,7) (11,15) (21,12)
