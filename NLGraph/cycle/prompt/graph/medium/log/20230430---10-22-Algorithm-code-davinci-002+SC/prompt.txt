To determine whether or not there is a cycle in an undirected graph, you can use a depth-first search algorithm to traverse the graph.
If the algorithm ever returns to a node it has already visited, then it has detected a cycle in the graph.

In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 5, and the edges are: (3,4) (3,5) (1,0) (2,5) (2,0)
Q: Is there a cycle in this graph?
A: No, there is no cycle in this graph.

In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 5, and the edges are: (3,5) (1,0) (3,0) (3,4) (4,1) (2,3)
Q: Is there a cycle in this graph?
A: The edges (3,0), (1,0), (4,1), (3,4), (3,0) forms a cycle, so yes, there is a cycle in this graph.

In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 7, and the edges are: (7,1) (5,7) (0,2) (3,7) (2,4) (5,6) (2,6)
Q: Is there a cycle in this graph?
A: No, there is no cycle in this graph.

In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 5, and the edges are: (0,1) (2,6) (2,0) (5,3) (1,4) (4,7) (3,7) (6,4)
Q: Is there a cycle in this graph?
A: The edges (0,1), (1,4), (6,4), (2,6), (2,0) forms a cycle, so yes, there is a cycle in this graph.


In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 24, and the edges are: (9,10) (1,0) (2,22) (16,22) (22,13) (20,10) (15,18) (5,10) (10,6) (9,8) (17,4) (1,15) (11,2) (19,11) (5,3) (0,17) (2,0) (0,16) (24,2) (10,14) (20,0) (12,14) (23,5) (6,7) (11,15) (21,12)
Q: Is there a cycle in this graph?
