In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 11, and the edges are: (2,8) (9,0) (0,2) (0,3) (4,1) (6,1) (1,0) (9,11) (0,5) (9,2) (8,10) (7,3) (10,3) (6,9)
Q: Is there a cycle in this graph?
A:The edges (0,9) (9,2) (2,8) (8,10) (10,3) (3,0) form a cycle, so yes, there is a cycle in this graph

In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.

Q: Is there a cycle in this graph?
A: No, there is no cycle in this graph.

In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 15, and the edges are: (0,1) (12,8) (9,10) (0,2) (0,14) (0,7) (8,9) (4,15) (5,6) (12,1) (7,3) (4,13) (5,12) (0,11) (4,14) (7,12) (10,2)
Q: Is there a cycle in this graph?
A:The edges (0,1) (1,12) (12,8) (8,9) (9,10) (10,2) (2,0) form a cycle, so yes, there is a cycle in this graph.
