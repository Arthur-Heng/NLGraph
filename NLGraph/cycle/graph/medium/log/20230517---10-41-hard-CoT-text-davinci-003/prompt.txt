In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 26, and the edges are: (15,2) (18,15) (11,10) (4,17) (24,20) (1,16) (24,12) (26,7) (0,3) (25,3) (21,4) (15,8) (0,2) (13,26) (13,23) (2,9) (0,1) (24,10) (22,11) (6,25) (6,23) (24,0) (19,18) (5,18) (8,14) (15,25) (8,0) (23,21)
Q: Is there a cycle in this graph?
A:The edges (0,3) (3,25) (25,15) (15,2) (2,0) form a cycle, so yes, there is a cycle in this graph.
