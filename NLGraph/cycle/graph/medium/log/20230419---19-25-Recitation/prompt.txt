In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 5, and the edges are: (3,4) (3,5) (1,0) (2,5) (2,0)
Q1: Are node 3 and node 5 connected with an edge?
A1: Yes.
Q2: Are node 1 and node 5 connected with an edge?
A2: No.
Q: Is there a loop in this graph?
A: No, there is no loop in this graph.

In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 5, and the edges are: (3,5) (1,0) (3,0) (3,4) (4,1) (2,3)
Q1: Are node 3 and node 4 connected with an edge?
A1: Yes.
Q2: Are node 1 and node 3 connected with an edge?
A2: No.
Q: Is there a loop in this graph?
A: The edges (3,0), (1,0), (4,1), (3,4), (3,0) forms a loop, so yes, there is a loop in this graph.

In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 7, and the edges are: (7,1) (5,7) (0,2) (3,7) (2,4) (5,6) (2,6)
Q1: Are node 7 and node 3 connected with an edge?
A1: Yes.
Q2: Are node 2 and node 5 connected with an edge?
A2: No.
Q: Is there a loop in this graph?
A: No, there is no loop in this graph.

In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 5, and the edges are: (0,1) (2,6) (2,0) (5,3) (1,4) (4,7) (3,7) (6,4)
Q1: Are node 0 and node 2 connected with an edge?
A1: Yes.
Q2: Are node 4 and node 5 connected with an edge?
A2: No.
Q: Is there a loop in this graph?
A: The edges (0,1), (1,4), (6,4), (2,6), (2,0) forms a loop, so yes, there is a loop in this graph.
