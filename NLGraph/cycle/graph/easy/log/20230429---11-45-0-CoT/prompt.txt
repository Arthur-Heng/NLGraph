In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the edges are: (0,2) (3,7) (5,3) (0,1) (3,0) (9,0) (8,4) (2,8) (1,7) (6,2) (5,0) (4,5)
Q: Is there a cycle in this graph?
A: Let's think step by step:
Acc: 83/150
Namespace(model=0, mode='easy', prompt='0-CoT', T=0, token=400, SC=0, SC_num=5)
