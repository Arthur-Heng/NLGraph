In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 5, and the edges are: (3,4) (3,5) (1,0) (2,5) (2,0). Let's construct a graph with the nodes and edges first.
Q: Is there a cycle in this graph?
A: No, there is no cycle in this graph.

In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 5, and the edges are: (3,5) (1,0) (3,0) (3,4) (4,1) (2,3). Let's construct a graph with the nodes and edges first.
Q: Is there a cycle in this graph?
A: The edges (3,0), (1,0), (4,1), (3,4), (3,0) forms a cycle, so yes, there is a cycle in this graph.

In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 7, and the edges are: (7,1) (5,7) (0,2) (3,7) (2,4) (5,6) (2,6). Let's construct a graph with the nodes and edges first.
Q: Is there a cycle in this graph?
A: No, there is no cycle in this graph.

In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 5, and the edges are: (0,1) (2,6) (2,0) (5,3) (1,4) (4,7) (3,7) (6,4). Let's construct a graph with the nodes and edges first.
Q: Is there a cycle in this graph?
A: The edges (0,1), (1,4), (6,4), (2,6), (2,0) forms a cycle, so yes, there is a cycle in this graph.


In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the edges are: (0,2) (3,7) (5,3) (0,1) (3,0) (9,0) (8,4) (2,8) (1,7) (6,2) (5,0) (4,5). Let's construct a graph with the nodes and edges first.
Q: Is there a cycle in this graph?
