In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the edges are: (0,2) (3,7) (5,3) (0,1) (3,0) (9,0) (8,4) (2,8) (1,7) (6,2) (5,0) (4,5)
Q: Is there a loop in this graph?
A: To determine whether there is a loop in this graph, we can use a depth-first search algorithm. This algorithm starts at a given vertex and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. If the algorithm visits a vertex that has already been visited, then there is a loop in the graph.
