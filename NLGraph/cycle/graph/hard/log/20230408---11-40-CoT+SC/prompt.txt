In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 5, and the edges are: (3,4) (3,5) (1,0) (2,5) (2,0)
Q: Is there a loop in this graph?
A: No, there is no loop in this graph.

In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 5, and the edges are: (3,5) (1,0) (3,0) (3,4) (4,1) (2,3)
Q: Is there a loop in this graph?
A: The edges (3,0), (1,0), (4,1), (3,4), (3,0) forms a loop, so yes, there is a loop in this graph.

In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 7, and the edges are: (7,1) (5,7) (0,2) (3,7) (2,4) (5,6) (2,6)
Q: Is there a loop in this graph?
A: No, there is no loop in this graph.

In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 5, and the edges are: (0,1) (2,6) (2,0) (5,3) (1,4) (4,7) (3,7) (6,4)
Q: Is there a loop in this graph?
A: The edges (0,1), (1,4), (6,4), (2,6), (2,0) forms a loop, so yes, there is a loop in this graph.


In an undirected graph, (i,j) means that node i and node j are connected with an undirected edge.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 34, and the edges are: (6,33) (12,34) (0,3) (2,12) (28,6) (23,0) (30,27) (27,22) (5,0) (16,15) (13,3) (0,14) (1,18) (16,20) (31,22) (16,5) (27,16) (10,14) (22,21) (1,0) (23,26) (27,29) (8,1) (9,12) (20,0) (4,18) (24,11) (4,29) (25,32) (1,11) (17,4) (24,7) (25,6) (2,0) (17,19) (19,32) (25,13) (4,0)
