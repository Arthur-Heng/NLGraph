In an undirected graph, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 4, and the edges are:
an edge between node 0 and node 1 with weight 2,
an edge between node 1 and node 4 with weight 1,
an edge between node 0 and node 2 with weight 1,
an edge between node 2 and node 3 with weight 1,
an edge between node 3 and node 4 with weight 2.
Think it through systematically.
Q: Give the shortest path from node 0 to node 4.
A: All the paths from node 0 to node 4 are:
0,1,4 with a total weight of 2 + 1 = 3,
0,2,3,4 with a total weight of 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.
The weight of path 0,1,4 is the smallest, so the shortest path from node 0 to node 4 is 0,1,4 with a total weight of 3.

Q: Give the shortest path from node 4 to node 2.
A: All the paths from node 4 to node 2 are:
4,5,1,0,2 with a total weight of 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6,
4,5,1,2 with a total weight of 1 + 1 + 3 = 5.
The weight of path 4,5,1,2 is the smallest, so the shortest path from node 4 to node 2 is 4,5,1,2 with a total weight of 5.

In an undirected graph, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 6, and the edges are:

Q: Give the shortest path from node 2 to node 0.
A: All the paths from node 2 to node 0 are:
2,1,0 with a total weight of 4 + 1 = 5,
2,5,1,0 with a total weight of 4 + 1 + 1 = 6,
2,3,1,0 with a total weight of 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
The weight of path 2,3,1,0 is the smallest, so the shortest path from node 2 to node 0 is 2,3,1,0 with a total weight of 3.

In an undirected graph, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 6, and the edges are:

0,2,6,5 with a total weight of 4 + 2 + 3 = 9,
0,1,2,6,5 with a total weight of 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 8,
0,4,6,5 with a total weight of 2 + 4 + 3 = 9,
0,4,3,5 with a total weight of 2 + 5 + 4 = 11.
The weight of path 0,1,2,6,5 is the smallest, so the shortest path from node 0 to node 5 is 0,1,2,6,5 with a total weight of 8.
