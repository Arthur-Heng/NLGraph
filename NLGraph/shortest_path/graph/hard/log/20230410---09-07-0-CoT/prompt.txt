In an undirected graph, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 19, and the edges are:
An edge between node 0 and node 4 with weight 7,
An edge between node 0 and node 11 with weight 5,
An edge between node 1 and node 7 with weight 2,
An edge between node 1 and node 15 with weight 8,
An edge between node 1 and node 5 with weight 6,
An edge between node 2 and node 19 with weight 8,
An edge between node 2 and node 11 with weight 9,
An edge between node 2 and node 9 with weight 4,
An edge between node 3 and node 16 with weight 1,
An edge between node 3 and node 15 with weight 9,
An edge between node 3 and node 8 with weight 6,
An edge between node 3 and node 13 with weight 8,
An edge between node 3 and node 14 with weight 8,
An edge between node 4 and node 5 with weight 8,
An edge between node 5 and node 7 with weight 5,
An edge between node 5 and node 15 with weight 9,
An edge between node 6 and node 11 with weight 8,
An edge between node 6 and node 8 with weight 2,
An edge between node 6 and node 17 with weight 6,

An edge between node 15 and node 19 with weight 2,
An edge between node 17 and node 18 with weight 9.
Q: Give the shortest path from node 12 to node 4.
A: Let's think step by step:
