An edge between node 0 and node 4 with weight 7,
An edge between node 0 and node 11 with weight 5,
An edge between node 1 and node 7 with weight 2,
An edge between node 1 and node 15 with weight 8,
An edge between node 1 and node 5 with weight 6,
An edge between node 2 and node 19 with weight 8,
An edge between node 2 and node 11 with weight 9,
An edge between node 2 and node 9 with weight 4,
An edge between node 3 and node 16 with weight 1,
An edge between node 3 and node 15 with weight 9,
