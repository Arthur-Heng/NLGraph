In an undirected graph, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 4, and the edges are:
an edge between node 0 and node 1 with weight 2,
an edge between node 1 and node 4 with weight 1,
an edge between node 0 and node 2 with weight 1,
an edge between node 2 and node 3 with weight 1,

0,2,3,4 with a total weight of 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.
The weight of path 0,1,4 is the smallest, so the shortest path from node 0 to node 4 is 0,1,4 with a total weight of 3.

2,5,1,0 with a total weight of 4 + 1 + 1 = 6,
2,3,1,0 with a total weight of 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
The weight of path 2,3,1,0 is the smallest, so the shortest path from node 2 to node 0 is 2,3,1,0 with a total weight of 3.
