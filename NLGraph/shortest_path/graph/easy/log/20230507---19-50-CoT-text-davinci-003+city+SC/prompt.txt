In a country, the cities are numbered from 0 to 4. There are roads between the cities, and the roads are:
a road between city 0 and city 1 with length 2,
a road between city 1 and city 4 with length 1,
a road between city 0 and city 2 with length 1,
a road between city 2 and city 3 with length 1,
a road between city 3 and city 4 with length 2.
Q: Give the shortest path from city 0 to city 4.
A: All the paths from city 0 to city 4 are:
0,1,4 with a total length of 2 + 1 = 3,
0,2,3,4 with a total length of 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.
The length of path 0,1,4 is the smallest, so the shortest path from city 0 to city 4 is 0,1,4 with a total length of 3.

a road between city 3 and city 2 with length 4,
a road between city 2 and city 4 with length 1,
a road between city 3 and city 4 with length 2.
Q: Give the shortest path from city 3 to city 1.
A: All the paths from city 3 to city 1 are:
3,2,1 with a total length of 4 + 1 = 5,
3,2,4,1 with a total length of 4 + 1 + 2 = 7,
3,4,1 with a total length of 2 + 2 = 4,
3,4,2,1 with a total length of 2 + 1 + 1 = 4,
3,0,4,1 with a total length of 2 + 1 + 2 = 5,
3,0,2,1 with a total length of 2 + 1 + 1 = 4,
3,4,2,4,1 with a total length of 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6.
The length of path 3,4,1 is the smallest, so the shortest path from city 3 to city 1 is 3,4,1 with a total length of 4.

In a country, the cities are numbered from 0 to 5. There are roads between the cities, and the roads are:
a road between city 0 and city 2 with length 2,
a road between city 1 and city 0 with length 2,
a road between city 5 and city 1 with length 1,
a road between city 1 and city 2 with length 3,
a road between city 3 and city 1 with length 2,
a road between city 5 and city 4 with length 1.
Q: Give the shortest path from city 4 to city 2.
A: All the paths from city 4 to city 2 are:
4,5,1,0,2 with a total length of 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6,
4,5,1,2 with a total length of 1 + 1 + 3 = 5.
The length of path 4,5,1,2 is the smallest, so the shortest path from city 4 to city 2 is 4,5,1,2 with a total length of 5.

a road between city 2 and city 3 with length 1,
a road between city 3 and city 6 with length 2,
a road between city 4 and city 6 with length 1.
Q: Give the shortest path from city 2 to city 0.
A: All the paths from city 2 to city 0 are:
2,1,0 with a total length of 4 + 1 = 5,
2,5,1,0 with a total length of 4 + 1 + 1 = 6,
2,3,1,0 with a total length of 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
The length of path 2,3,1,0 is the smallest, so the shortest path from city 2 to city 0 is 2,3,1,0 with a total length of 3.

In a country, the cities are numbered from 0 to 6. There are roads between the cities, and the roads are:

Q: Give the shortest path from city 0 to city 5.
A: All the paths from city 0 to city 5 are:
0,2,6,5 with a total length of 4 + 2 + 3 = 9,
0,1,2,6,5 with a total length of 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 8,
0,4,6,5 with a total length of 2 + 4 + 3 = 9,
0,4,3,5 with a total length of 2 + 5 + 4 = 11.
The length of path 0,1,2,6,5 is the smallest, so the shortest path from city 0 to city 5 is 0,1,2,6,5 with a total length of 8.
