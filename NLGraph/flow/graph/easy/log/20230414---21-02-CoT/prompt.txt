In a directed graph, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 3, and the edges are:
an edge from node 1 to node 0 with capacity 10,
an edge from node 0 to node 2 with capacity 6,
an edge from node 2 to node 3 with capacity 4.
Q: What is the maximum flow from node 1 to node 3?
A: We can arrange the flow as follows:
from node 1 to node 0: 10,
from node 1 to node 0: 6,
from node 1 to node 0: 4,
total flow from node 1 to node 3: 4.
So the maximum flow from node 1 to node 3 is 4.
