In a directed graph, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 3, and the edges are:
an edge from node 1 to node 0 with capacity 10,
an edge from node 0 to node 2 with capacity 6,
an edge from node 2 to node 3 with capacity 4.
Q: What is the maximum flow from node 1 to node 3?
A: From the source (node 1), we can send 10 units of flow to node 0.
10 units of flow arrive at node 0, then we can send 6 units of flow from node 0 to node 2.
6 units of flow arrive at node 0, then we can send 4 units of flow from node 2 to node 3.
The total unit of flow arrives at node 3 is 4. So the maximum flow from node 1 to node 3 is 4.

In a directed graph, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 4, and the edges are:
an edge from node 0 to node 3 with capacity 3,
an edge from node 0 to node 4 with capacity 10,
an edge from node 1 to node 3 with capacity 3,
an edge from node 1 to node 4 with capacity 5,
an edge from node 2 to node 1 with capacity 10,
an edge from node 3 to node 1 with capacity 10,
an edge from node 3 to node 4 with capacity 1,
an edge from node 4 to node 3 with capacity 2.
Q: What is the maximum flow from node 0 to node 4?
A: From the source (node 0), we can send 10 units of flow to node 4, and 3 units of flow to node 3.
3 units of flow arrive at node 3, then we can send 3 units of flow from node 3 to node 1.
3 units of flow arrive at node 1, then we can send 3 units of flow from node 1 to node 4.
The total unit of flow arrives at node 4 is 13. So the maximum flow from node 0 to node 4 is 13.

In a directed graph, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 4, and the edges are:
an edge from node 0 to node 1 with capacity 10,
an edge from node 1 to node 2 with capacity 6,
an edge from node 0 to node 2 with capacity 2,
an edge from node 1 to node 3 with capacity 6,
an edge from node 3 to node 2 with capacity 3,
an edge from node 2 to node 4 with capacity 5,
an edge from node 3 to node 4 with capacity 8.
Q: What is the maximum flow from node 0 to node 4?
A: From the source (node 0), we can send 10 units of flow to node 1, and 2 units of flow to node 2.
10 units of flow arrive at node 1, then we can send 6 units of flow from node 3 to node 1, and 4 units of flow from node 3 to node 2.
6 units of flow arrive at node 2, then we can send 5 units of flow from node 2 to node 4.
6 units of flow arrive at node 3, then we can send 6 units of flow from node 3 to node 4.
The total unit of flow arrives at node 4 is 11. So the maximum flow from node 0 to node 4 is 11.

In a directed graph, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 5, and the edges are:
an edge from node 0 to node 4 with capacity 8,
an edge from node 2 to node 0 with capacity 2,
an edge from node 2 to node 4 with capacity 6,
an edge from node 3 to node 1 with capacity 7,

an edge from node 4 to node 1 with capacity 2,
an edge from node 4 to node 5 with capacity 2,
an edge from node 5 to node 4 with capacity 7.
Q: What is the maximum flow from node 2 to node 1?
A: From the source (node 1), we can send 2 units of flow to node 0, and 6 units of flow to node 4.
2 units of flow arrive at node 0, then we can send 2 units of flow from node 0 to node 4.
8 units of flow arrive at node 4, then we can send 2 units of flow from node 4 to node 1, and 6 units of flow from node 4 to node 3.
6 units of flow arrive at node 3, then we can send 6 units of flow from node 3 to node 1.
The total unit of flow arrives at node 4 is 8. So the maximum flow from node 2 to node 1 is 8.

In a directed graph, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 6, and the edges are:
an edge from node 0 to node 3 with capacity 1,
an edge from node 1 to node 4 with capacity 7,

an edge from node 3 to node 4 with capacity 4,
an edge from node 3 to node 1 with capacity 7,
an edge from node 5 to node 1 with capacity 9,
an edge from node 6 to node 4 with capacity 10.
Q: What is the maximum flow from node 2 to node 4?
A: From the source (node 2), we can send 1 units of flow to node 0, 6 units of flow to node 1, and 6 units of flow to node 4.
1 unit of flow arrive at node 0, then we can send 1 unit of flow from node 0 to node 4.
6 units of flow arrive at node 1, then we can send 6 units of flow from node 1 to node 4.
The total unit of flow arrives at node 4 is 13. So the maximum flow from node 2 to node 4 is 13.
