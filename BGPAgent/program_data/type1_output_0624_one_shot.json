We know that AS 1239 is a transit AS for both AS 721 and AS 27065.\n2. The fact that AS 721 has a lower transit degree than AS 27065 suggests that AS 721 is a customer of AS 1239 and AS 27065 is either a customer or a peer of AS 1239.\n3.

In this case, 1239 is likely providing transit services to 13395, making 1239 the provider and 13395 the customer.\n\nSo, the output would be:\n\n[\"1239-13395: p2c\"]",
